# Web service uptime axum

Web service that displays the program uptime by using Axum, Tokio, Rust.

This is a very simple web service that we use for testing our systems.

## Steps

Run the service on host 0.0.0.0 port 3000 or wherever you wish:

```sh
cargo run -- "0.0.0.0:3000"
```

Browse <https://localhost:3000>

You should see a web page that displays the uptime in seconds.
